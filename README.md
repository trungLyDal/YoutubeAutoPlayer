You got it! A good README.md file is essential for any GitHub repository. It's the first thing people see and tells them what your project is, how it works, and how to use it.

Here's a comprehensive README.md for your "YouTube NonStop Watcher" extension, formatted in Markdown so you can directly copy and paste it into a file named README.md in the root of your project folder.

YouTube NonStop Watcher
 ## üì∫ Overview

The YouTube NonStop Watcher is a lightweight and efficient browser extension designed to automatically dismiss the "Are you still watching?" prompt that appears on YouTube after periods of inactivity. This ensures an uninterrupted and seamless viewing experience, perfect for long videos, extended playlists, background music, or when you simply don't want to be bothered by the prompt.

Tired of having your playback paused because YouTube thinks you've left? This extension is your solution! It silently detects the prompt and clicks "Continue watching" so you can keep enjoying your content without interruption.

‚ú® Features
Uninterrupted Playback: Automatically clicks "Continue watching" to keep your videos playing.

Silent Operation: Works entirely in the background without any visible pop-ups or distractions.

Lightweight & Efficient: Built with minimal code to ensure it doesn't slow down your Browse.

Cross-Browser Compatibility: Designed to function across major browsers like Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, and Opera.

Easy to Use: No configuration needed after installation ‚Äì just install and forget!

üõ†Ô∏è How It Works
This extension operates as a content script that is injected directly into YouTube web pages. Its core functionality involves:

Constant Monitoring: The script periodically (every 2 seconds by default) scans the active YouTube page.

Smart Prompt Detection: It specifically looks for the "Are you still watching?" dialog by targeting its unique HTML structure (yt-confirm-dialog-renderer) and ensuring the dialog is actually visible on the screen.

Targeted Button Click: Once a visible prompt is identified, the script locates and programmatically simulates a click on the "Yes" or "Continue watching" button within that specific dialog.

Seamless Dismissal: This action dismisses the prompt, allowing your video to continue playing as if you had clicked it yourself.

3. Test the Extension
Open a new tab in your browser and go to YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/).

Start playing any video or a playlist.

Leave the tab open and inactive for a period (e.g., 20-60 minutes, as the exact duration can vary based on YouTube's current behavior and your device).

The extension should automatically dismiss the "Are you still watching?" prompt, allowing your content to continue playing without any interruption.

While on a YouTube tab, open your browser's Developer Tools:

Chrome/Edge/Opera: Press F12 or right-click -> "Inspect".
